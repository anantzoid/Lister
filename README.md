# Lister

This project was an initiative to get my hands dirty with AngularJS, Yeoman, Firebase while I was sitting around with a fractured elbow.

Currently it supports the following functionalities:

* Make lists (todo/reading/or whatever list) and store them. 
* Log in to save the lists and access from anywhere.
* Share a copy of your list with anyone.
* Save a shared list to your account.


## Install Instructions

`cd` into the cloned directory and run:

    `npm install`
    `bower insall`

Do install [bower] and [npm] if you do not have them.

Create a [firebase] account and include your app link in *scripts/config.js*

## Build & development

Run `grunt` for building and `grunt serve` for preview.
