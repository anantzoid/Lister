This project was an initiative to get my hands dirty with AngularJS, Yeoman, Firebase while I was sitting around with a fractured elbow.

You can add links to create a reading list (for now) and share and publish them (this is still left to do).

This project is generated with [yo angular generator](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-angular)
version 0.11.1.

## Install Dependencies

`cd` into the cloned directory and run:

    `npm install`
    `bower insall`

Do install [bower] and [npm] if you do not have them.

Create a [firebase] account and include your app link in *scripts/app.js*

## Build & development

Run `grunt` for building and `grunt serve` for preview.
